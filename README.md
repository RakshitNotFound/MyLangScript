# MyLangScript

This is a custom-built, minimalist programming language and compiler designed to introduce fundamental concepts of lexing, parsing, and code generation. Inspired by basic arithmetic and print operations, features simple syntax for variable declaration, assignment, and output. The project includes a lexer to tokenize input, a parser to create an abstract syntax tree (AST), and a code generator to produce executable JavaScript code.
